PLEASE READ (Some theming instructions):

This is basically the Hangouts layout that is contained in Talon.

This layout will work fine, but obviously since I am providing you the resource, you can change it literally however you want.
You do have to make sure you don't change any of the ID's or the remove any items though or you will cause force closes that I will
have to deal with :/ That is not what I want!

Pretty much you can do anything with this, I made a few comments throughout saying not to change this, or if you do
how the behavior should be. Please follow those simple guidelines so we can create the best experience. Pretty much just watch for visiblity on
the expansion. You can set any of the other items to gone or invisible to hide them though.

This is a very powerful tool that I have given here. Say you wanted to make a Falcon theme or something, you could do that pretty easily.
Just recreate the layout

So enjoy and make this into something very cool :)

And just an FYI, dimen values aren't going to work, for some reason, they can't be found from my app, don't know why.
So you will have to hard-code all the values. Also, changing the font sizes will do no good, as i set them according to the user's
preference on the fly.


I have added an action bar drawable that you can theme with the newest version of the app. You could do transparent if you would like
but the drawer shadow makes things just a little bit weird and there is no way around it. You will see what I mean if you try it.
